Bean and beef Burritos
======================

*Yield*: 12-16 small burritos
*Total Time*: 2 hours
*Active Time*: 80 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2 blocks of beef
* 1 head cauliflower (optional)
* 300 g black beans
* 5.5 Tbsp southwest seasoning
* 3-4 onions (sweet or red)
* Some peppers (optional). I prefer red bell peppers and chillies.
* 12-16 small tortillas.

## Process

* If using dry beans, put them on the stove and boil them for two hours.

### beef

* Press the two blocks of beef and preheat the oven to 425 Â°F after it is pressed.
* Cut the beef along the longest axis into approximately 0.5-inch long slabs.
* Mix 4 Tbsp of southwest seasoning with oil, and coat each slab of beef well with the
  oil mixture, adding more oil as necessary to coat all the slabs.
* Bake the beef slabs to the desired toughness for 35 to 45 minutes.
* When the beef is finished, cut each slab into 6 small strips and put them aside.

#### Cauliflower (Optional)

* If adding cauliflower, break apart a head into small florets.
* Add some oil and a tablespoon of southwest seasoning to a bowl with
  the cauliflower, mixing until the cauliflower is well coated.
* Place the cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake it with the beef for
  25-30 minutes.

### Onions

* Slice the onions into approximately 0.5-inch rings and split the rings in half.
* Stir-fry the onions in a small amount of oil until fully caramelized. This generally
  takes at least half an hour, depending on the size of the onions, heat level, etc.
* If desired, add sliced peppers when the onions have significantly reduced in size, frying them
  for at least 10 minutes.
* 5 minutes before removing the stir-fry, add a teaspoon of the southwest seasoning to the onions
  with some additional oil. If there is any oil mixture left from the beef, that may be added instead.

### Beans

* Add some southwest seasoning and salt to the beans to taste. If desired, mix in some salsa with the
  beans.

### Assembly

* To create the burritos, fill each tortilla with some filling and top with your favourite salsa.
